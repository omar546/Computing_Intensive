# README

This repository contains code snippets for various statistical calculations and simulations. Each section focuses on a specific topic and provides corresponding code examples.

## Contents

1. Game Simulation
   - The `play_game` function simulates a game and returns the number of rolls needed to achieve certain outcomes.
   - Simulate the game 1000 times and estimate the expected number of rolls needed.
   - Display a histogram of the number of rolls needed.

2. Bootstrap and Jackknife Resampling
   - Perform bootstrap and jackknife resampling methods on combined data sets.
   - Calculate sample mean, bias, standard error, and 95% confidence interval using each method.

3. Weight Gain Data Analysis
   - Analyze weight gain data using bootstrap resampling.
   - Generate bootstrap samples and calculate the mean of each.
   - Display a histogram of the bootstrap distribution and calculate the bootstrap standard error.
   - Calculate a 90% confidence interval using the bootstrap standard error.

4. Normal Distribution Estimation
   - Fit a normal distribution to a given data set.
   - Estimate the parameters of the normal distribution.
   - Calculate a 99% confidence interval for the estimated parameters.

## Usage

To use the code snippets in this repository, you can copy the relevant code sections and integrate them into your own projects. Each section is accompanied by explanatory comments to guide you through the code.

Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed if specified in the code (e.g., `MASS`).
